# Positioning Clarification

This repository does not audit hardware architectures (GPU, TPU, or others).

It presents a failure-oriented, black-box reasoning validation approach:
by systematically applying adversarial questions to expose reasoning breakdowns,
responsibility gaps, and narrative collapse under pressure.

Any reference to execution environments should be understood as contextual,
not methodological constraints.
